				<h3>Workflow Building Blocks: The Success Story of Environmental Modeling, HPC, and AI for Predicting Farmed Seafood Bacteria Contamination</h3>
				<p>
					Scientific workflows processing enormous amounts of data using distributed HPC systems or on-demand computational resources are a solid and reliable paradigm in data science. The orchestration of environmental models to produce simulations or forecasts is a more widespread routine production workflow application. This presentation concerns our vision of workflows as building blocks for environmental applications, combining numerical and artificial intelligence models to produce augmented environmental forecasts and predictions. <a href="https://github.com/dagonstar/" target="_blank">DagOnStar</a> is the workflow engine developed at the HPSC SmartLab of the University of Naples "Parthenope" for orchestrating environmental models used by the Center for Monitoring and Modeling Marine and Atmosphere (<a href="https://meteo.uniparthenope.it" target="_blank">CMMMA</a>) applications to orchestrate the weather and marine forecast production. The Center runs a routinary workflow application to predict the contamination by Escherichia Coli (E. Coli) in farmed mussels, augmenting the forecasted pollutant transport and diffusion (<a href="https://github.com/ccmmma/wacommplusplus" target="_blank">WaComM++ model</a>) with an artificial intelligence model  (<a href="https://github.com/ccmmma/aiquam" target="_blank">AIQUAM model</a>) trained with microbiological measurements. The first assessment and evaluation of the system demonstrate that the workflow application can predict E. Coli presence with an accuracy of more than 90%.

					Raffaele Montella is an Associate Professor with tenure in Computer Science at the Department of Science and Technologies (DiST), University of Naples “Parthenope" (UNP), Italy. He got his degree in (Marine) Environmental Science at the University of Naples “Parthenope" in 1998. He defended his Ph.D. thesis on "Environmental modeling and Grid Computing techniques" earning a Ph.D. in Marine Science and Engineering at the University of Naples "Federico II". He leads the High-Performance Scientific Computing (HPSC) Laboratory and the IT infrastructure of the UNP Center for Marine and Atmosphere Monitoring and Modeling (CMMMA). His main research topics and scientific production are focused on: tools for high-performance computing, cloud computing, and GPUs with applications in the field of computational environmental science (multi-dimensional geo-referenced big data, distributed computing for modeling, and scientific workflows and science gateways) leveraging on his previous (and still ongoing) experiences in embedded, mobile, wearable, pervasive computing, and Internet of Things.

				<h3>FAIRIST of them all: Meeting researchers where they are with just-in-time, FAIR implementation advice</h3>
				<p>
					Intellectual freedom, curiosity, and creativity are qualities of the academic landscape that appeal to many researchers. But a blank page in the wrong context can halt creativity, such as creating a data management and sharing plan. A goal for research support staff, as well as for researchers themselves, is to lower time spent on the mechanics of research to make more time for open-ended discovery. For data-driven science, this includes collecting and processing data so that one can find and combine research objects later. It also means preparing research objects, such as data, software, and workflows, for later reuse by others. The FAIR principles provide a conceptual framework for comprehensively ensuring research assets are accessible for reuse. Currently researchers apply the FAIR practices as best they can, based on community practices, lessons learned on the job, and other mentorship they may have received. This talk will explore how FAIR implementation practices – or any other practice that aids data management and sharing, can be provided to researchers and customized to their specific research tasks. Research workflows can be improved through new ways of sharing hard won knowledge, and through processes that allow for peer assessment. These data sources can be repurposed in existing tools or through new interfaces, such as the FAIR+ Implementation Survey Tool (FAIRIST).

		<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

		<p>
			Scientific workflows have been used almost universally across scientific domains and have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several decades. Workflow management systems (WMSs) provide abstraction and automation, which enable a broad range of researchers to easily define sophisticated computational processes and to then execute them efficiently on parallel and distributed computing systems. As workflows have been adopted by a number of scientific communities, they are becoming more complex and require more sophisticated workflow management capabilities. A workflow now can analyze terabyte-scale data sets, be composed of one million individual tasks, require coordination between heterogeneous tasks, manage tasks that execute for milliseconds to hours, and can process data streams, files, and data placed in object stores. The computations can be single core workloads, loosely coupled computations, or tightly all within a single workflow, and can run in dispersed computing platforms, from edge to core resources.
		</p>

		<p>
			This workshop focuses on the many facets of scientific workflow management systems, ranging from actual execution to service management and the coordination and optimization of data, service, and job dependencies. The workshop covers a broad range of issues in the scientific workflow lifecycle that include: scientific workflows representation and enactment; workflow scheduling techniques to optimize the execution of the workflow on heterogeneous infrastructures; workflow enactment engines that need to deal with failures in the application and execution environment; and a number of computer science problems related to scientific workflows such as semantic technologies, compiler methods, scheduling and fault detection and tolerance.
