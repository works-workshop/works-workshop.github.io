<p>
    Papers should present original research and should provide sufficient background material to make them
    accessible to the broader community.
</p>
<div class="chairs dates">

    There will be two forms of presentations:<br/><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Talks - Full papers (up to 8 pages)</strong><br/>
            Describing a research contribution in the topics listed above.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Lightning Talks - Abstracts (up to 1 page)</strong><br/>
            Describing a novel tool and or scientific workflow.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Submission of a full paper may result in a talk, submission of an abstract may result in a lightning talk.
        Presenters of full papers will be given a 20-minute time slot (plus 5 minutes for questions) to provide a
        summary and update to their research work. Presenters of abstracts will be given a 10-minute time slot
        (including 3 minutes for questions) to present a novel tool or scientific workflow.
    </p>
    <strong style="font-weight: bold">Submission Guidelines:</strong><br/><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Full papers</strong><br/>
            Submissions are limited to 8 pages. The 8-page limit includes figures, tables, appendices, and references.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Abstracts</strong><br/>
            Submissions are limited to 1 page (excluding references). The 1-page limit includes the description of a
            novel tool/science workflow, and a link of a repository in which the novel source-code of the tool is
            stored. This repository will need to specify all the instructions necessary to execute the tool, so
            reviewers can test it. Abstracts will be compiled into a single paper and published as part of the workshop
            proceedings.
        </li>
    </ul>

    All submitted papers (full papers and abstracts) will undergo a rigorous review process and each will have at least
    three reviews by members of the program committee. Papers will be accepted based on their technical contributions.

    <br/><br/>

    <p>
        Papers and abstracts should be submitted in the <strong>IEEE format</strong> (see
        <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">

        <br/>
        WORKS papers this year will be published in cooperation with
        <a href="https://tc.computer.org/tchpc/" target="_blank">TCHPC</a> and they will be available from IEEE
        digital repository.
