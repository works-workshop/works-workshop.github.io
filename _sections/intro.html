    Scientific workflows have been almost universally used across scientific domains and have underpinned some of the
    most significant discoveries of the past several decades. Workflow management systems (WMSs) provide abstraction and
    automation which enable a broad range of researchers to easily define sophisticated computational processes and to
    then execute them efficiently on parallel and distributed computing systems. As workflows have been adopted by a
    number of scientific communities, they are becoming more complex and require more sophisticated workflow management
    capabilities. A workflow now can analyze terabyte-scale data sets, be composed of one million individual tasks,
    require coordination between heterogeneous tasks, manage tasks that execute for milliseconds to hours, and can
    process data streams, files, and data placed in object stores. The computations can be single core workloads,
    loosely coupled computations, or tightly all within a single workflow, and can run in dispersed computing platforms.
    <br/><br/>
    This workshop focuses on the many facets of scientific workflow management systems, ranging from actual execution to
    service management and the coordination and optimization of data, service, and job dependencies. The workshop covers
    a broad range of issues in the scientific workflow lifecycle that include: scientific workflows representation and
    enactment; workflow scheduling techniques to optimize the execution of the workflow on heterogeneous
    infrastructures; workflow enactment engines that need to deal with failures in the application and execution
    environment; and a number of computer science problems related to scientific workflows such as semantic
    technologies, compiler methods, scheduling and fault detection and tolerance.
