<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em">
    Scientific workflows have been almost universally used across scientific domains and have underpinned some of
    the most significant discoveries of the past several decades. Workflow management systems (WMSs) provide
    abstraction and automation which enable a broad range of researchers to easily define sophisticated computational
    processes and to then execute them efficiently on parallel and distributed computing systems. As workflows have
    been adopted by a number of scientific communities, they are becoming more complex and require more
    sophisticated workflow management capabilities. A workflow now can analyze terabyte-scale data sets, be
    composed of one million individual tasks, require coordination between heterogeneous tasks, manage tasks that
    execute for milliseconds to hours, and can process data streams, files, and data placed in object stores. The
    computations can be single core workloads, loosely coupled computations, or tightly all within a single workflow,
    and can run in dispersed computing platforms.
    <br/><br/>
    This workshop focuses on the many facets of scientific workflow
    management systems, ranging from actual execution to service management and the coordination and
    optimization of data, service, and job dependencies. The workshop covers a broad range of issues in the scientific
    workflow lifecycle that include: scientific workflows representation and enactment; workflow scheduling
    techniques to optimize the execution of the workflow on heterogeneous infrastructures; workflow enactment
    engines that need to deal with failures in the application and execution environment; and a number of computer
    science problems related to scientific workflows such as semantic technologies, compiler methods, scheduling
    and fault detection and tolerance.
