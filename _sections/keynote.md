        This talk is about molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that study the 
        classical time evolution of a molecular system at atomic resolution. 
        These simulations are widely recognized in the fields of chemistry, 
        material sciences, molecular biology and drug design; they are also 
        one of the most common simulations on supercomputers. Today MD simulations 
        are the most common simulations running on petascale machines. A survey 
        of resources used on XSEDE machines over the past six months shows how 
        biomolecular codes (predominantly MD codes such as Amber, CHARMM, and NAMD) 
        use 25.7% of the XSEDE resources (i.e., total amount of XD service units 
        (SUs) used by jobs in the field of science indicated). Work of Luu and 
        co-authors show how HPC resources can be up to 75% idle, performing I/O 
        operations while running scientific simulations because of poor data 
        handling. Next-generation supercomputers will have dramatically higher 
        performance than current systems, generating more data that needs to be 
        analyzed (i.e., in terms of number and length of molecular dynamics 
        trajectories). The coordination of data generation and analysis cannot 
        rely on manual, centralized approaches as it does now.

        The talk presents an interdisciplinary project integrating research from 
        various areas across programs such as computer science, structural 
        molecular biosciences, and high-performance computing to transform the 
        centralized nature of the molecular dynamics analysis into a distributed 
        approach that is predominantly performed in situ. Specifically, the effort 
        presented in this talk combines machine learning and data analytics 
        approaches, workflow management methods, and high performance computing 
        techniques to analyze molecular dynamics data as it is generated, save 
        to disk only what is really needed for future analysis, and annotate 
        molecular dynamics trajectories to drive the next steps in increasingly 
        complex simulations' workflows. The project's harnessed knowledge of 
        molecular structures' transformations at runtime can be used to steer 
        simulations to more promising areas of the simulation space, identify 
        the data that should be written to congested parallel file systems, and 
        index generated data for retrieval and post-simulation analysis.

        <a href="https://globalcomputing.group/about.html" target="_blank">Michela 
        Taufer</a> is an ACM Distinguished Scientist and holds the Jack Dongarra 
        Professorship in High Performance Computing in the Department of Electrical 
        Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Tennessee Knoxville 
        (UTK). She earned her undergraduate degrees in Computer Engineering from 
        the University of Padova (Italy) and her doctoral degree in Computer Science 
        from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology or ETH (Switzerland). From 
        2003 to 2004 she was a La Jolla Interfaces in Science Training Program 
        (LJIS) Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) 
        and The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), where she worked on interdisciplinary 
        projects in computer systems and computational chemistry. Taufer has a long 
        history of interdisciplinary work with scientists. Her research interests 
        include software applications and their advanced programmability in 
        heterogeneous computing (i.e., multi-core platforms and GPUs); cloud computing 
        and volunteer computing; and performance analysis, modeling and optimization 
        of multi-scale applications. She has been serving as the principal investigator 
        of several NSF collaborative projects. She also has significant experience in 
        mentoring a diverse population of students on interdisciplinary research. 
        Taufer's training expertise includes efforts to spread high-performance 
        computing participation in undergraduate education and research as well as 
        efforts to increase the interest and participation of diverse populations in 
        interdisciplinary studies.
