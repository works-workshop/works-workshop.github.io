				<h3>Making easier the development and deployment of application workflows with eFlows4HPC</h3>
				<p>
					While distributed computing infrastructures are becoming increasingly complex, the user community provides more complex application workflows to leverage them.  In addition, current trends aim to use data analytics and artificial intelligence combined with HPC modeling and simulation.
					However, the programming models and tools are different in these fields, and there is a need for 
					methodologies that enable the development of workflows that combine HPC software, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. The eFlows4HPC project aims at providing a workflow software stack that fulfills this need. 
					The project is also developing the HPC Workflows as a Service (HPCWaaS) methodology that aims at providing tools to simplify the development, deployment, execution, and reuse of workflows. The project showcases its advances with three application Pillars with industrial and social relevance: manufacturing, climate, and urgent computing for natural hazards. The talk will present the actual progress and findings of the project.  
				</p>

She is the manager of the Workflows and Distributed Computing research group at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). She has made significant contributions to Parallel programming models for multicore and distributed computing due to her contribution to task-based programming models during the last 15 years. The research group focuses on PyCOMPSs/COMPSs, a parallel task-based programming distributed computing, and its application to the development of large heterogeneous workflows that combine HPC, Big Data, and Machine Learning. Dr Badia has published nearly 200 papers in international conferences and journals on the topics of her research. She has been active in projects funded by the European Commission in contracts with industry. She is a member of HiPEAC Network of Excellence.

		<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

		<p>
			Scientific workflows have been used almost universally across scientific domains and have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several decades. Workflow management systems (WMSs) provide abstraction and automation, which enable a broad range of researchers to easily define sophisticated computational processes and to then execute them efficiently on parallel and distributed computing systems. As workflows have been adopted by a number of scientific communities, they are becoming more complex and require more sophisticated workflow management capabilities. A workflow now can analyze terabyte-scale data sets, be composed of one million individual tasks, require coordination between heterogeneous tasks, manage tasks that execute for milliseconds to hours, and can process data streams, files, and data placed in object stores. The computations can be single core workloads, loosely coupled computations, or tightly all within a single workflow, and can run in dispersed computing platforms, from edge to core resources.
		</p>

		<p>
			This workshop focuses on the many facets of scientific workflow management systems, ranging from actual execution to service management and the coordination and optimization of data, service, and job dependencies. The workshop covers a broad range of issues in the scientific workflow lifecycle that include: scientific workflows representation and enactment; workflow scheduling techniques to optimize the execution of the workflow on heterogeneous infrastructures; workflow enactment engines that need to deal with failures in the application and execution environment; and a number of computer science problems related to scientific workflows such as semantic technologies, compiler methods, scheduling and fault detection and tolerance.
