				<h3>The Evolution of Automation in Science — The Pegasus Perspective</h3>
				<p>
					Over the past two decades, the scientific workflow community has transformed how science is conducted at scale — moving from manual scripting and ad hoc data movement to automated, intelligent systems that enable reproducible, data-driven discovery. Since its founding in 2006, the WORKS workshop has chronicled this evolution, documenting the shift from early grid-enabled workflows to today’s AI-augmented, self-optimizing systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					This keynote reflects on that journey through the lens of the Pegasus Workflow Management System, one of the earliest and most enduring platforms for scientific automation. It traces how core computer science principles—abstraction, optimization, provenance, and adaptability—have guided Pegasus’s evolution from workflow planning for distributed systems to orchestrating AI-driven, agentic, and self-managing workflows. The talk will conclude with a look toward the future of science automation, where hybrid physical and cyber infrastructures work together to advance knowledge and discovery.
				</p>
				<p style="font-size: 0.9em; font-style: italic">
				Ewa Deelman's main area of research is distributed computing. She researches how to best support complex scientific applications on a variety of computational environments, including campus clusters, grids, and clouds. She has designed new algorithms for job scheduling, resource provisioning, and data storage optimization in the context of scientific workflows.
				Since 2000, she has been conducting research in scientific workflows and has been leading the design and development of the Pegasus software that maps complex application workflows onto distributed resources. Pegasus is used by a broad community of researchers in astronomy, bioinformatics, earthquake science, gravitational-wave physics, limnology, and others.
				Ewa Deelman is also the Principal Investigator for the CI Compass, the NSF Cyberinfrastructure Center of Excellence, which provides leadership, expertise, and active support to cyberinfrastructure practitioners at NSF Major Facilities and throughout the research ecosystem in order to enable ongoing evolution of technologies, practices, and our field, ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of the cyberinfrastructure upon which research and discovery depend.
				In addition, she is interested in issues of distributed data management, high-level application monitoring, and resource provisioning in grids and clouds.

		<h1>Call for Papers</h1>		
				<p>
					Scientific workflows have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several decades. Workflow management systems (WMSs) provide abstraction and automation that enable researchers to easily define sophisticated computational processes, and to then execute them efficiently on parallel and distributed computing systems. As workflows have been adopted by multiple scientific communities, they are becoming more complex and require more sophisticated workflow management capabilities. A workflow can now analyze terabyte-scale data sets; execute millions of individual tasks; coordinate heterogeneous resources and tasks from edge to core; and process near real-time data streams, files, and data placed in different types of storage systems. The computations can be single core workloads, loosely-coupled tasks, or tightly-coupled computations, and can run in heterogeneous distributed computing platforms all within a single workflow.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					The <em>Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science (WORKS)</em> focuses on the many facets of scientific workflow composition, management, sustainability, and application to domain sciences in an increasingly diverse and a rapidly evolving technology landscape. <strong>WORKS aims to serve as the central meeting point for all the stakeholders involved in the evolving workflows community, and to showcase the latest developments and emerging approaches in the field.</strong>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					WORKS25 will be held in conjunction with the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC25) at the America’s Center Convention Complex in downtown St. Louis, Missouri (USA). 
				</p>
		
				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">Topics for the workshop</h3>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0">
					WORKS25 welcomes original submissions in a broad range of topics in the scientific workflow lifecycle, including but not limited to:
