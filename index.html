			{{site.acronym}} focuses on the many facets of scientific workflow management systems, ranging from
			actual execution to service management and the coordination and optimization of data, service, and job
			dependencies. The workshop covers a broad range of issues in the scientific workflow lifecycle that include:
			scientific workflows representation and enactment; workflow scheduling techniques to optimize the execution
			on heterogeneous infrastructures; workflow enactment engines that deal with failures in the application and
			infrastructure; and a number of computer science problems related to scientific workflows such as semantic
			technologies, compiler methods, fault tolerance, etc.

		<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

		<p>
			Escience researchers often invest significant time and effort in projects
      that can have unexpected outcomes. When results are obtained that do not fit
      the established molds expected by publishing venues, these results can be lost.
      The ERROR Workshop invites research results from computing and computational
      projects that encounter unexpected or negative results that would be difficult
      to report on elsewhere. 
     </p>

		<p>
			Novel hardware technologies and machine learning approaches
			(among others) are rapidly changing approaches, methods, and scale applied in
			escience domains. Researchers must deal with this novelty in multiple
			dimensions, many of which are beyond their control. Consequently, it is likely
			that some of the obtained results will not be of the expected form: they are
			negative (deviating from initial hypothesis), abnormal (anomalous to results
			from similar studies), or otherwise not useful in the established sense.
		</p>

		<p>
			Under normal circumstances, such negative results and why they were obtained
			are seldom discussed, analyzed and published. Useful lessons are thus lost to
			the scientific community. Yet ignoring such results and the process by which
			they were obtained poses a risk of repetition. The fact that other researchers
			likely face the same situations and the same pitfalls further increases the
			cost of research, a cost that would have been avoided if the negative results
			were brought forward and discussed in-depth within and across communities.
		</p>
