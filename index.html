				<h3>Workflow Building Blocks: The Success Story of Environmental Modeling, HPC, and AI for Predicting Farmed Seafood Bacteria Contamination</h3>
				<p>
					Scientific workflows processing enormous amounts of data using distributed HPC systems or on-demand computational resources are a solid and reliable paradigm in data science. The orchestration of environmental models to produce simulations or forecasts is a more widespread routine production workflow application. This presentation concerns our vision of workflows as building blocks for environmental applications, combining numerical and artificial intelligence models to produce augmented environmental forecasts and predictions. <a href="https://github.com/dagonstar/" target="_blank">DagOnStar</a> is the workflow engine developed at the HPSC SmartLab of the University of Naples "Parthenope" for orchestrating environmental models used by the Center for Monitoring and Modeling Marine and Atmosphere (<a href="https://meteo.uniparthenope.it" target="_blank">CMMMA</a>) applications to orchestrate the weather and marine forecast production. The Center runs a routinary workflow application to predict the contamination by Escherichia Coli (E. Coli) in farmed mussels, augmenting the forecasted pollutant transport and diffusion (<a href="https://github.com/ccmmma/wacommplusplus" target="_blank">WaComM++ model</a>) with an artificial intelligence model  (<a href="https://github.com/ccmmma/aiquam" target="_blank">AIQUAM model</a>) trained with microbiological measurements. The first assessment and evaluation of the system demonstrate that the workflow application can predict E. Coli presence with an accuracy of more than 90%.

					Raffaele Montella is an Associate Professor with tenure in Computer Science at the Department of Science and Technologies (DiST), University of Naples “Parthenope" (UNP), Italy. He got his degree in (Marine) Environmental Science at the University of Naples “Parthenope" in 1998. He defended his Ph.D. thesis on "Environmental modeling and Grid Computing techniques" earning a Ph.D. in Marine Science and Engineering at the University of Naples "Federico II". He leads the High-Performance Scientific Computing (HPSC) Laboratory and the IT infrastructure of the UNP Center for Marine and Atmosphere Monitoring and Modeling (CMMMA). His main research topics and scientific production are focused on: tools for high-performance computing, cloud computing, and GPUs with applications in the field of computational environmental science (multi-dimensional geo-referenced big data, distributed computing for modeling, and scientific workflows and science gateways) leveraging on his previous (and still ongoing) experiences in embedded, mobile, wearable, pervasive computing, and Internet of Things.

				<h3>FAIRIST of them all: Meeting researchers where they are with just-in-time, FAIR implementation advice</h3>
				<p>
					Intellectual freedom, curiosity, and creativity are qualities of the academic landscape that appeal to many researchers. But a blank page in the wrong context can halt creativity, such as creating a data management and sharing plan. A goal for research support staff, as well as for researchers themselves, is to lower time spent on the mechanics of research to make more time for open-ended discovery. For data-driven science, this includes collecting and processing data so that one can find and combine research objects later. It also means preparing research objects, such as data, software, and workflows, for later reuse by others. The FAIR principles provide a conceptual framework for comprehensively ensuring research assets are accessible for reuse. Currently researchers apply the FAIR practices as best they can, based on community practices, lessons learned on the job, and other mentorship they may have received. This talk will explore how FAIR implementation practices – or any other practice that aids data management and sharing, can be provided to researchers and customized to their specific research tasks. Research workflows can be improved through new ways of sharing hard won knowledge, and through processes that allow for peer assessment. These data sources can be repurposed in existing tools or through new interfaces, such as the FAIR+ Implementation Survey Tool (FAIRIST).

					Christine Kirkpatrick leads the San Diego Supercomputer Center’s (SDSC) Research Data Services division, which manages large-scale infrastructure, networking, and services for research projects of regional and national scope. Her duties also include a leadership role on the Schmidt Futures Foundation and NSF-funded Open Storage Network and as leader of the Data Core for the NIH-funded Metabolomics Workbench, a national data repository for metabolomics studies. Her research in computer science has centered on improving machine learning processing through research data management techniques. In addition to being PI of the EarthCube Office (ECO), Kirkpatrick founded the US GO FAIR Office, is PI of the West Big Data Innovation Hub, and Co-PI on an NSF Accelnet: Designing a Water, Data, and Systems Science Network of Networks to Catalyze Transboundary Groundwater Resiliency Research.

		<h1>Call for Papers</h1>		
				<p>
				Scientific workflows have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several decades. Workflow management systems (WMSs) provide abstraction and automation that enable researchers to easily define sophisticated computational processes, and to then execute them efficiently on parallel and distributed computing systems. As workflows have been adopted by multiple scientific communities, they are becoming more complex and require more sophisticated workflow management capabilities. A workflow can now analyze terabyte-scale data sets; execute millions of individual tasks; coordinate heterogeneous resources and tasks from edge to core; and process near real-time data streams, files, and data placed in different types of storage systems. The computations can be single core workloads, loosely-coupled tasks, or tightly-coupled computations, and can run in heterogeneous distributed computing platforms all within a single workflow. 
				</p>
		
				<p>
				The Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science (WORKS) focuses on the many facets of scientific workflow composition, management, sustainability, and application to domain sciences in an increasingly diverse and a rapidly evolving technology landscape. WORKS aims to serve as the central meeting point for all the stakeholders involved in the evolving workflows community, and to showcase the latest developments and emerging approaches in the field.
		
				</p>
		
				<p>
				WORKS25 will be held in conjunction with the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC25) at the America’s Center Convention Complex in downtown St. Louis, Missouri (USA).

					Full Papers will undergo a thorough, single blind review process. Each full paper will receive at least three reviews from experts in our Workshop Program Committee. Each full paper will be presented at the workshop, and be included in the SC Workshop Proceedings. Our committee will value efforts towards improving the reproducibility and transparency of the presented research. We encourage full paper submissions to include information about relevant software and data artifacts within the paper. Authors are also encouraged to make available online any products of their paper (e.g., simulators, graphs, experimental results, logs, etc.). However, dedicated Artifact Description (AD)/Artifact Evaluation (AE) appendices are not expected as part of the submission.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Abstracts will undergo a thorough, single blind review process and each will receive at least three reviews from experts in our Workshop Program Committee. Based on the content of the accepted abstracts, the Workshop Chairs will organize a Panel discussion during the workshop centered around the topic of “Trailblazing vs. Time-Tested: Navigating the Future of Scientific Workflows”. One author from each accepted abstract will participate in the panel discussion. Accepted abstracts will not be included in the SC Workshop Proceedings. Unlike some of the previous editions of WORKS, abstracts will not be compiled into a full paper.
